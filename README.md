# seat-billing
A billing system for mining/PvE costs for corps/alliances.

Thanks to denngarr for writing the original plugin. (And at the same time, what kind of mess did you create?)

## Quick Installation:

See the instruction over at the [seat documentation](https://eveseat.github.io/docs/community_packages/).

The package name is `recursivetree/seat-billing`.

You should schedule a job running 'billing:update' as often as you want the live data to be updated.

Good luck, and Happy Hunting!!  o7
